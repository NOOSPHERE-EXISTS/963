## Noosphere Exists (LUX) Foundation Fund Distribution

The funds held in escrow wallets are allocated for long-term distribution and will be managed by the **LUX Foundation**. 

Initial support will go directly to individuals or institutions in genuine need. Funds will be released gradually over the years, not all at once. At later stages, new wallets will be available for funding and support. Finally, the Foundation will award the Crown of the World — a symbolic honor and grant — to individuals who have made exceptional contributions to human well-being, truth, and peace. This initiative may be seen as a future equivalent to the Nobel Prize.
