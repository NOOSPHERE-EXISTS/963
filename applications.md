## XOO Foundation Fund Distribution

The funds held in escrow wallets are allocated for long-term distribution and will be managed by the XOO Foundation. 

Initial support will go directly to individuals or institutions in genuine need. Funds will be released gradually over the years, not all at once. At later stages, new wallets will be available for funding and support. Finnaly, the Foundation will award the Crown of the World — a symbolic honor and grant — to individuals who have made exceptional contributions to human well-being, truth, and peace. This initiative may be seen as a future equivalent to the Nobel Prize.

## Application

All funded projects and applications will be made public.

The XOO Foundation Committee will oversee the selection process and disbursement of funds.

Applications will remain open in the coming years. For updates, please refer to the email provided in our official PGP key.

All public communications from the XOO Foundation will always be signed to ensure authenticity.
