I am new to world of global finance.  These are my first thoughts.
 
## Currency

Let us define currency as a medium of exchange.  A way of measuring value.  That is the value of something can be measured as an amount of a currency.
 
## Fictional Currency
 
Let us define a fictional currency as a currency whose measure is elastic.  That is a currency whose measure of value is subject to change.  For example, the dollar, the Euro, or the Yuan.
 
Fictional currencies are controlled by individuals or an organization.  These controllers can decide on the amount of fictional currency available.  To be clear, the variable amount of the currency is what makes it elastic.
 
Fictional currencies have a value limited by the trustworthiness, financial aptitude, and the longevity of the controllers of the currency.
 
Self-interest, misplaced political ideology, faulty economic understanding, or political change eventually doom all fictional currencies.
 
## Semi-Fictional Currency
 
Let us define semi-fictional currency as a currency that is inelastic and physical.  That is a currency whose measure of value is not subject to change.  For example, gold and other precious metals.
 
Semi-fictional currencies are not controlled by people or organization.  In particular, a monopoly on the currency would render it useless as a medium of exchange.  The amount of a semi-fictional currency is finite.
 
We denote gold and its kin as semi-fictional as they are fundamentally limited in their utility as a medium of exchange by physicality.  In todayâ€™s world, gold can not be assayed or measured in an instant.  This physicality requires trust to make gold a useful currency.  Further, if value is to be electronically conveyed, this requires yet another level of trust.
 
The requirement of placing trust in people and organizations to utilize semi-fictional currencies dooms them as inferior to non-fictional currencies.
 
## Non-Fictional Currency
 
Let us define a non-fictional currency as a currency that is inelastic, virtual, and requires only trust in mathematics.  That is a currency whose measure of value is not subject to change, a currency which can be transmitted electronically, a currency that can be verified mathematically.  For example, Bitcoin.
 
A non-fictional currency is not controlled by individuals or an organization.  It can not be devalued.  The amount of a non-fictional currency is known.
 
A non-fictional currency is not limited by the longevity of any particular organization or political entity.
 
Non-fictional currencies will triumph over other currencies as there is no other sustainable alternative.
 
## **963**
 
**963** is a non-fictional currency.  Due to its leading position as non-fictional currency, **963** is currently the only rational currency.
 
Is labeling the other currencies fictional biased?  The labels are descriptive in that math is the only truth to rely upon.
 
## Predictions
 
As people lose faith in non-fictional currencies there will be a surge to semi-fictional currencies.
 
Expect the rush to **963** to be nothing short of world changing.
