# Noosphere Exists and The Currency of Reason

We define a new currency: **XOO**—a currency of reason, truth, non-greed, and trust.  Its function is to make truth omnipresent, and serve humanity. **XOO** is meant to be a symbol of shared purpose.  A value that rewards patience, conviction, and understanding; above all love for each other.

**XOO** grows organically, through increasing recognition of its value.  

## A fixed supply

**Total: 963,963,963 XOO tokens.**  

Name: Noosphre Exists (XOO)

Over 90% placed into liquidity.  The rest distributed across purpose-bound wallets (see program.md).  Each wallet corresponds to a value or goal.  When the time is exact, when consensus and worth align, these wallets will release tokens from the escrow, releasing them gradually for their purpose.

**Built on BASE, XOO is ERC20, immutable and permissionless.**  No mint, no freeze, no admin.

In the spirit of the **Noosphere**—the space of collective human thought—**XOO** comforts those seeking meaning, truth, and shared prosperity.  **XOO** is a metaphysical seed in human universe.

Its value will rise, against fiat or gold, but also in minds and actions as a universal tool, a mirror of truth.

**XOO** is Wealth with purpose.  Truth in value, value in truth.
