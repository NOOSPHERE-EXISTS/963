# "Noosphere Exists" and The Currency of Reason

## Prologue
We define a new currency: **LUX**—a currency of reason, of non-greed, and of trust.  Its function is to make truth omnipresent, and to alert humanity.  **LUX** is meant to be a symbol of shared purpose; above all love for each other.  The **Noosphere** is a space of collective human thought—it comforts those seeking meaning, and shared prosperity; the teaching about the sense of life through moral practice.  Planetary values are based on the ideas of harmony, and co-evolution of All-humanity and the Universe; life fighting chaos and entropy.  **LUX** is a metaphysical seed. Therefore, the **Noosphere Exists**.


## Disposition

**LUX** is ERC20, immutable and permissionless; without mint, without freeze, without ownership, without tax.

Total fixed supply: 963,963,963 **LUX** tokens.  Over 90% placed into the locked liquidity.  The rest distributed across purpose-bound wallets (see program.md).  Each wallet corresponds to a value or goal.  When the time is exact, when consensus and worth align, these wallets will release tokens from the escrow, releasing them gradually for their purpose.

**LUX** grows organically, through increasing recognition of its value.  Its value will rise, against fiat or gold, but also in minds and actions as a universal tool.  **LUX** is wealth with purpose.  Truth in value, value in truth.
